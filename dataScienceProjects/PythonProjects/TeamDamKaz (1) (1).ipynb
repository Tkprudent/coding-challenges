    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "We observed that there is a sudden increase in the bike usage at this time of the year as most\n",
    "of the Bikes located at the Foy Center gets checked out quite often, although we were not\n",
    "able to get the Clarksville bikeshare data, but this inspired our interest in analysing the\n",
    "Nashville bikeshare data we got, due to the fact that we both have riding bicycle for an\n",
    "hobby.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA COLLECTION\n",
    "We collected the dataset from Mr. Kenneth Abbott who is a Managing Director at Morgan\n",
    "Stanley for over 20 years and an Adjunct Professor at NYU. We had a symposium in the\n",
    "department sometime ago and he explained about maximizing predictive analytics to solving\n",
    "real life issues. He then explained that he had access to the Nashville Bikeshare data which\n",
    "was given to him from a reliable source and we contacted him for the data to apply the\n",
    "knowledge acquired in the Python for Data Science to analyse the data.\n",
    "The data consists of 233,212 observations and 35 features, the link to the dataset is attached\n",
    "in this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcPy1Ot32pNxz4KK5reM72tmAtgAQ-Y8/view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBJECTIVES:\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to categorize our questions in two-tiers;\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as a business consultant to make smarter decisions that saves cost, maximize profit and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  What are the checkout and return kiosks with highest usage rate?\n",
    "*  What is the average trip duration?\n",
    "*  For an annual award ceremony, we like to know the top 20 users with highest trip duration.\n",
    "*  What is the average calories burned?\n",
    "*  What day of the week has highest pickup rate?\n",
    "*  What season of the year has the highest trip duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Secondly, as a user or customer of the bike-share service, what are the factors that might\n",
    "    influence the usage of the service.\n",
    "*  What time of the day has the highest pickup rate?\n",
    "*  What is the statistics of the zip codes with kiosk present?\n",
    "*  hat is the statictic of membershipType used by riders?\n",
    "*  What is the average carbon offset as a result riding?"
