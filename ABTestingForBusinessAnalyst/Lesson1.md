This is a jotting of the lessons learnt from [AB Testing for Business Analyst udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979) taught by Patrick Nussbaumer, an Alteryx Data Scientist with over 20 years experience in the data analytics industry. I believe I would learn a lot from the course.

Suppose, as a bank you want to change operating hours in all your locations, a question to consider would be, will changing operating hours lead to better performance?

Using AB testing methodologies, you can design an experiment where you can determine if the performance of a group of branches with the modified hours have statistical significant results over the control branches.
