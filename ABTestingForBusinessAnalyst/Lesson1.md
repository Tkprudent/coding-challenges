This is a jotting of the lessons learnt from [AB Testing for Business Analyst udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979) taught by Patrick Nussbaumer, an Alteryx Data Scientist with over 20 years experience in the data analytics industry. I believe I would learn a lot from the course.

Suppose, as a bank you want to change operating hours in all your locations, a question to consider would be, will changing operating hours lead to better performance?

Using AB testing methodologies, you can design an experiment where you can determine if the performance of a group of branches with the modified hours have statistical significant results over the control branches, and you can use this information to guide your business decision.

In the course, I learnt how to set up AB test, AB testing is a type of experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and the variation in a controlled experiment. You can used AB test to solve business problems where you dont have enough data to build model upon.

Suppose you just became an analyst for a candy producing company and you want to create a new product but you are unsure as a company if you should go into full production or not. You are in a data poor situation because you don't have enough data to work with so instead you have to set up an experiment to be able to predict the likelihood of success of the product before the company launches into full production.

Each individual in a test is called a __unit__ e.g person, store, production line.

In our case study, we are trying to predict potential sales if a new product is introduced, so first we have to answer the question of how will you gather the data you need to figure out potential candy sales?
