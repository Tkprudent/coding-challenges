Here I want to document what I learnt about the model evaluation metrics for machine learning.

Evaluating a model is a core part of building an effective machine learning model. We have several model evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, cross-validation, AUC-ROC curve.

The idea of building machine learning models works on a constructive feedback principle, where you build a model, get feedback from the model, make improvements and continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy.
