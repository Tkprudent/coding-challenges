This is a document where I share what I learnt from watching the GS investor day. It is the first ever since the company was founded 150 years ago. I believe it would help me understand better the direction of the company should I be favored by God to join the company. There were several sessions and they were very educative to learn about differentiated capabilities GS delivers to her clients. 

There was also technology showcases that are organized by client-type for technologies that serve corporates,institutions and consumers. it helps to learn about the culture and history of innovation at Goldman Sachs.
