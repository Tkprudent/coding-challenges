This is a learning toolkit to help me highlight major points from SQL for Data Analysis course on Udacity.

__WHY SQL__

* It is easy to understand.
* Access data directly
* You dont need to worry about your program crashing because of data overload
* It is easy to audit and replicate.
* You can run data at once from multiple tables.

__WHY BUSINESSES LIKE DATABASES__

* Data integrity is ensured.
* Data can be accessed quickly.
* Data is easily shared.

1. CREATE TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
2. DROP TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database.
3. SELECT allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query, It indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.
