I believe you have got a similar email to the above and still wondering about how to prepare.

NB: The digital interview is on hirevue. There were 4/5 behavioural question. You get about 30 seconds to prepare each answer and two minutes to speak to the camera. There are no second chances.The whole thing over in 15-20 minutes. It is to basically test if your personality is a good fit for the company and this is tested to see how well your responses to situational and behavioral questions reveals who you are. You want to be distinct and unique in your own ways and not just a copied version of someone you read online.

The purpose of the Hirevue in my opinion would be to aid the recruitment team find answers to very important questions that indicates if you are the ideal person they would admire to work with daily, so you have to learn your personality shine forth. You don't have to let panic attack, or anxiety attacks or fear take the best part of you. 

There are pertinent and fundamental questions that they seek to know, which are:
* Why do you want to work at Goldman Sachs
* Why are you interested in the division(s) you applied?
* What makes you stand-out amongst other candidates.

According to the author, she says, _"Behavioral questions are asked to get to know you personally, to understand your resume more deeply, and just to ease you into an interview"_

### INTRODUCTION

* Walk me through your resume.

This question is aimed at helping you have the opportuity to work the recruiter through your resume. You should seek to address key areas in your resume where your best is most highlighted instead of bothering on irrelevances.

* Why do you want to work for Goldman Sachs?

You are encouraged to visit the [GS careers webpage](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/blog/index.html) or [GS home page ](https://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html) to find enough answers to defend why you want to work at GS.


* Why do you want to work for division X?

You should review the divisions you decided to choose in your initial application, you can find it under your application portal. You can read more about the [different divisions at GS and their roles](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/index.html).

* What is your biggest achievement so far?

This kinds of questions are to have been prepared for before you ever do a video interview, because if you are caught off guard, you would find yourself rambling and struggling through an answer, this is because so many achievements will flood your mind and you would be contemplating which is the biggest and most striking.

To avoid such kinds of debate going on in your head and hence an inability to properly disect this question, I suggest you take time to plan an answer or meditate on this question, and know what to say.

They both explain you should pick a quality the company seeks in an ideal candidate and then pick an accomplishment that you can share that your skills, talents, and expertise are the perfect fit. You should also pick an accomplishment that you're proud of, so as to get lit up and enlivened.


* What would make you a good fit with Goldman Sachs?
 You have to highlight that your strengths and distinct characteristics that makes you a good fit for the job. Why should the recruiter choose you amongst many other candidates?

* What's your core expertise? How have you applied that to a project?

This could be a mix of both technical skills as well as soft skills. You want to always make your personality well revealed.

* What's your greatest strength?

* Why did you choose your major?
