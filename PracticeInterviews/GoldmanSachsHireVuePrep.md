We think you'll find the pre-recorded video interview a great experience - interview anywhere, anytime that's most convenient for you and tell your story in a more personalized, dynamic way than a static resume.

Thank you for your interest in a career with us,
Goldman Sachs Recruiting Team

I believe you have got a similar email to the above and still wondering about how to prepare.

NB: The digital interview is on hirevue. There were 4/5 behavioural question. You get about 30 seconds to prepare each answer and two minutes to speak to the camera. There are no second chances.The whole thing over in 15-20 minutes. It is to basically test if your personality is a good fit for the company and this is tested to see how well your responses to situational and behavioral questions reveals who you are. You want to be distinct and unique in your own ways and not just a copied version of someone you read online.

The purpose of the Hirevue in my opinion would be to aid the recruitment team find answers to very important questions that indicates if you are the ideal person they would admire to work with daily, so you have to learn your personality shine forth. You don't have to let panic attack, or anxiety attacks or fear take the best part of you. 

There are pertinent and fundamental questions that they seek to know, which are:
* Why do you want to work at Goldman Sachs
* Why are you interested in the division(s) you applied?
* What makes you stand-out amongst other candidates.

According to the author, she says, _"Behavioral questions are asked to get to know you personally, to understand your resume more deeply, and just to ease you into an interview"_

Along the top, as columns, you should list all the major aspects of your resume, including each project, job,
or activity. Along the side, as rows, you should list the common behavioral questions.
Study this grid before your interview.

Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid
easier to study and recall. You can also more easily have this grid in front of you during an interview without
it being a distraction.

These are some of the practice questions gotten from different sources to make preparation easy.

### INTRODUCTION

* Walk me through your resume.

This question is aimed at helping you have the opportuity to work the recruiter through your resume. You should seek to address key areas in your resume where your best is most highlighted instead of bothering on irrelevances.

* Why do you want to work for Goldman Sachs?

You are encouraged to visit the [GS careers webpage](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/blog/index.html) or [GS home page ](https://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html) to find enough answers to defend why you want to work at GS.


* Why do you want to work for division X?

You should review the divisions you decided to choose in your initial application, you can find it under your application portal. You can read more about the [different divisions at GS and their roles](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/index.html).

* What is your biggest achievement so far?

This kinds of questions are to have been prepared for before you ever do a video interview, because if you are caught off guard, you would find yourself rambling and struggling through an answer, this is because so many achievements will flood your mind and you would be contemplating which is the biggest and most striking.

To avoid such kinds of debate going on in your head and hence an inability to properly disect this question, I suggest you take time to plan an answer or meditate on this question, and know what to say.

They both explain you should pick a quality the company seeks in an ideal candidate and then pick an accomplishment that you can share that your skills, talents, and expertise are the perfect fit. You should also pick an accomplishment that you're proud of, so as to get lit up and enlivened.


* What would make you a good fit with Goldman Sachs?
 You have to highlight that your strengths and distinct characteristics that makes you a good fit for the job. Why should the recruiter choose you amongst many other candidates?

* What's your core expertise? How have you applied that to a project?

This could be a mix of both technical skills as well as soft skills. You want to always make your personality well revealed.

* What's your greatest strength?

* Why did you choose your major?


### CONFLICT RESOLUTION & TIME MANAGEMENT:

* A team member isn't contributing. You confront them. They still don't contribute. What next?

* How do you handle a client who goes against the company policy?

* Talk me through a time you had to resolve a conflict with someone senior to you.

* Give me an example of a time when you worked in a team with conflict. How did you deal with this? 

* Talk me through a time you were working in a team and someone wasn't pulling their weight.

* Tell me about a time when you have had to turn down a project or opportunity because you had a conflict or competing deadline. What were the competing priorities that you were facing?  How and when did you decline the opportunity or project? What was the result of turning it down?

* Please describe a time when a teacher or manager questioned a decision you made and you had to explain the reasoning behind that decision. Please describe your thought process and the outcome. Looking back, would you have done anything differently?

What steps would you take to ensure the success of the project?

* You are working on a secret project. Your previous manager asks about it. He says he wants information on the project to help with an important decision. What do you do?

### Tips for Responding to Behavioral Questions from CTCI

* Be Specific, Not Arrogant
Specificity means giving just the flags and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation.

* Limit Details
Stay light on details and just state the key points, avoid blabbering on about a problem such that the interviewer finds it hard to follow.

* Focus on yourself, not your team
Don't leave your interviewer clueless about your actual impact on the project.

* Give Structured Answers

* Nugget First:
For example:
Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change:'

Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach
their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where .. :'

This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very clear what your story will be about. It
also helps you be more focused in your communication, since you've made it very clear to yourself what
the gist of your response is.

S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result)

The S.A.R. approach means that you start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took,
and lastly, describing the result.

__Example: ''Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate:'__

Situation: On my operating systems project, I was assigned to work with three other people. While two
were great, the third team member didn't contribute much. He stayed quiet during meetings, rarely
chipped in during email discussions, and struggled to complete his components. This was an issue not
only because it shifted more work onto us, but also because we didn't know if we could count on him.

Action: I didn't want to write him off completely yet, so I tried to resolve the situation. I did three things.

First, I wanted to understand why he was acting like this. Was it laziness? Was he busy with something
else? I struck up a conversation with him and then asked him open-ended questions about how he felt it
was going. Interestingly, basically out of nowhere, he said that he wanted to take on the writeup, which
is one of the most time intensive parts. This showed me that it wasn't laziness; it was that he didn't feel
like he was good enough to write code.

Second, now that I understand the cause, I tried to make it clear that he shouldn't fear messing up. I told
him about some of the bigger mistakes that I made and admitted that I wasn't clear about a lot of parts
of the project either.

Third and finally, I asked him to help me with breaking out some of the components of the project. We
sat down together and designed a thorough spec for one of the big component, in much more detail
than we had before. Once he could see all the pieces, it helped show him that the project wasn't as scary
as he'd assumed.

Result: With his confidence raised, he now offered to take on a bunch of the smaller coding work, and
then eventually some of the biggest parts. He finished all his work on time, and he contributed more in
discussions. We were happy to work with him on a future project.

What personality attributes has the candidate demonstrated?

* Initiative/Leadership: The candidate tried to resolve the situation by addressing it head-on.

* Empathy: The candidate tried to understand what was happening to the person. The candidate also
showed empathy in knowing what would resolve the teammate's insecurity.

* Compassion: Although the teammate was harming the team, the candidate wasn't angry at the teammate.
His empathy led him to compassion.

* Humility: The candidate was able to admit to his own flaws (not only to the teammate, but also to the
interviewer).

* Teamwork/Helpfulness: The candidate worked with the teammate to break down the project into
manageable chunks.

You should think about your stories from this perspective. Analyze the actions you took and how you
reacted. What personality attributes does your reaction demonstrate?

So, tell me about yourself...

Many interviewers kick off the session by asking you to tell them a bit about yourself, or asking you to walk
through your resume. This is essentially a "pitch''. It's your interviewer's first impression of you, so you want
to be sure to nail this.

Structure

A typical structure that works well for many people is essentially chronological, with the opening sentence
describing their current job and the conclusion discussing their relevant and interesting hobbies outside
of work (if any).

1. Current Role [Headline Only]: "I'm a software engineer at Microworks, where I've been leading the
Android team for the last five years:'
2. College: My background is in computer science. I did my undergrad at Berkeley and spent a few
summers working at startups, including one where I attempted to launch my own business.
3. Post College & Onwards: After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined
Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to
really drive the launch of a key part of AWS. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more
entrepreneurial environment.
4. Current Role [Details]: One of my old managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup,
which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaled
pretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage a
team of three, but my role is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.
5. Outside of Work: Outside of work, I've been participating in some hackathons-mostly doing iOS
development there as a way to learn it more deeply. I'm also active as a moderator on online forums
around Android development.
6. Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the
connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.
