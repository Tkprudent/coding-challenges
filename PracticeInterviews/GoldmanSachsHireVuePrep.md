Digital interview is on hirevue. There were 4 behavioural question. I get 30 seconds to prepare each answer and two minutes to speak to the camera. There are no second chances.The whole thing over in 15-20 minutes.

The purpose of the Hirevue in my opinion would be to aid the recruitment team find answers to very important questions that indicates if you are the ideal person they would admire to work with daily, so you have to learn your personality shine forth. You don't have to let panic attack, or anxiety attacks or fear take the best part of you. 

There are pertinent and fundamental questions that they seek to know, which are:
* Why do you want to work at Goldman Sachs
* Why are you interested in the division(s) you applied?
* What makes you stand-out amongst other candidates.

Hints from Cracking the coding interview by Gayle McDowell on how to hack behavioural questions.


These are some of the practice questions gotten from different sources to make preparation easy.
