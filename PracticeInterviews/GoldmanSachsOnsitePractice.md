I have taken some time to surf the web, to get preparatory materials for my onsite interviews, these are compiled from various sources and instead of having to open different webpages, I have tried milking the necessary materials that I feel will help me prepare.

Congratulations, you have received the invite for your GS Superday, the long awaited on-site interview is finally here and you are trying to get practice materials to get prepped up for the on-site interview. Here are some of the experiences of some previous candidates.

The interviews are heavily resume dependent. They'll ask you questions on it. For some reason, my interviewer was some Senior Tech recruiter;
 * Why CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are better than simple perceptron 

* If you are a member of your student body and the president of the student body posts solution to some exam on an online forum; what would you do about it'

* Print the odd numbers from m to n (m being bigger)

* Print all prime numbers from 1 to n in optimal time. 

* How does linear regression work on a clustered dataset. 

* Why should GS hire you?

* Tell me about yourself

* What makes a good engineer

* A coworker A cannot work with her coworker B; what do you do?

* How can you make sure some parts of code aren't modified by other people later?

* You have vector A, vector B, given both these vectors; run through all elements and print if any element x, 'is present in A', 'is present in B', or 'is present in both'.

Here are some tips I found online before we proceed on other interview questions.

* Know where you are interested in Goldman Sachs. Have a good reason. It is shocking how many candidates are not prepared to answer "Why Goldman?"

* Be prepared to talk about your research and projects. We want to learn about your technical projects, so be prepared to discuss these projects in depth. Re-read your Github code, and make sure you are able to efficiently describe your technical coursework.

* Be able to explain why you want to work in finance as opposed to tech. As a strat, you have a lot of opportunities (data science, software engineering, etc.). Thus, you need to have a good reason to work at Goldman. The firm does not hire people they think are going to stay two years and then switch to a tech firm. We want people truly interested in the problems we solve.

* Ask the interviewers solid questions at the end, and smile. If they ask you a technical question and you don't know the answer, say I do not know. 

* When asked a brain teaser type question, make sure you don't just answer right away, take 20-30 seconds to think and express your thought process. 

* Demonstrate your interest in finance, and specifically Goldman. Everyone has an answer for why Goldman other than the fact they are the best. They know they are the best, tell them something you value about the firm that you have noticed through talking with people, observing the firm, and researching online.
