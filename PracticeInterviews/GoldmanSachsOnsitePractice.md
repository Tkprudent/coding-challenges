I have taken some time to surf the web, to get preparatory materials for my onsite interviews, these are compiled from various sources and instead of having to open different webpages, I have tried milking the necessary materials that I feel will help me prepare.

Congratulations, you have received the invite for your GS Superday, the long awaited on-site interview is finally here and you are trying to get practice materials to get prepped up for the on-site interview. Here are some of the experiences of some previous candidates.

The interviews are heavily resume dependent. They'll ask you questions on it. For some reason, my interviewer was some Senior Tech recruiter;
 * Why CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are better than simple perceptron 

* If you are a member of your student body and the president of the student body posts solution to some exam on an online forum; what would you do about it'

* Print the odd numbers from m to n (m being bigger)

* Print all prime numbers from 1 to n in optimal time. 

* How does linear regression work on a clustered dataset. 

* Why should GS hire you?

* Tell me about yourself

* What makes a good engineer

* A coworker A cannot work with her coworker B; what do you do?

* How can you make sure some parts of code aren't modified by other people later?

* You have vector A, vector B, given both these vectors; run through all elements and print if any element x, 'is present in A', 'is present in B', or 'is present in both'.
