I have taken some time to surf the web, to get preparatory materials for my onsite interviews, these are compiled from various sources and instead of having to open different webpages, I have tried milking the necessary materials that I feel will help me prepare.

Congratulations, you have received the invite for your GS Superday, the long awaited on-site interview is finally here and you are trying to get practice materials to get prepped up for the on-site interview. Here are some of the experiences of some previous candidates.

Prepare to answer [why Goldman Sachs](https://www.10xebitda.com/why-goldman-sachs-investment-banking-interview-answer/)

The interviews are heavily resume dependent. They'll ask you questions on it. For some reason, my interviewer was some Senior Tech recruiter;
 * Why CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are better than simple perceptron 

* If you are a member of your student body and the president of the student body posts solution to some exam on an online forum; what would you do about it'

* Print the odd numbers from m to n (m being bigger)

* Print all prime numbers from 1 to n in optimal time. 

* How does linear regression work on a clustered dataset. 

* Why should GS hire you?

* Tell me about yourself

* What makes a good engineer

* A coworker A cannot work with her coworker B; what do you do?

* How can you make sure some parts of code aren't modified by other people later?

* You have vector A, vector B, given both these vectors; run through all elements and print if any element x, 'is present in A', 'is present in B', or 'is present in both'.

Here are some tips I found online before we proceed on other interview questions.

* Know where you are interested in Goldman Sachs. Have a good reason. It is shocking how many candidates are not prepared to answer "Why Goldman?"

* Be prepared to talk about your research and projects. We want to learn about your technical projects, so be prepared to discuss these projects in depth. Re-read your Github code, and make sure you are able to efficiently describe your technical coursework.

* Be able to explain why you want to work in finance as opposed to tech. As a strat, you have a lot of opportunities (data science, software engineering, etc.). Thus, you need to have a good reason to work at Goldman. The firm does not hire people they think are going to stay two years and then switch to a tech firm. We want people truly interested in the problems we solve.

* Ask the interviewers solid questions at the end, and smile. If they ask you a technical question and you don't know the answer, say I do not know. 

* When asked a brain teaser type question, make sure you don't just answer right away, take 20-30 seconds to think and express your thought process. 

* Demonstrate your interest in finance, and specifically Goldman. Everyone has an answer for why Goldman other than the fact they are the best. They know they are the best, tell them something you value about the firm that you have noticed through talking with people, observing the firm, and researching online.

Here are some popular leetcode problems to consider and try solving before the super day

* [minimum-size-subarray-sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

* [hashmap-design](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)

* [alient-dictionary-verifyer](https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/)

* [lru-cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

* [decode-ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

* Given an array it should contain 0 to N-1 values such as arr[i] = i, if value is not present in given array then arr[i] = -1;
eg: {-1,-1,5,6,4,-1,2} -> {-1, -1, 2, -1, 4, 5, 6}

* Input contains List, String -> possibleAnagram {"to", "toe", "toes"}, "eot" -> return true question was updated for this case: {"to", "toe", "toes"}, "eot*" -> true as * is replaced by anyCharacter

* List of possible currency conversions from one to another, find whether there is a cycle.

It was a great experience for me having my on site interview on February 4th, 2020. I arrived at the venue 20 minutes before and had a good chat with other students who came for the interview. I feel it preety much helps to reduce stress and help get in the mood for a conversation.

It's going to start with you walking the interviewer through your resume, this is a point where you need to communicate effectively and let your personality shine forth. You don't need be afraid or upset about anything. Just express yourself freely.

After a long chat about my resume and describing the projects I have worked on, We moved to  the coding part of the problem. 

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/

I was also asked some SQL type question, revise group by, having, where and other sql use cases. I finally had a question on regression analysis talking about relationship between crime rate and budget.


The second interview started with a chat on my resume, after which I was asked some scenario based questions from my resume.

I was also asked some behavioural questions and then finally asked a coding problem.

General Advice.

Don't work yourself out and be afraid, stay calm and positive even when you missed the question. Try to communicate effectively to your interviewer about your  thoughts. Don't freak out even when the question seem hard just try your best to explain what you know and you would be fine.
