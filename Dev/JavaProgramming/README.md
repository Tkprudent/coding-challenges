I spoke with my manager and he told me as I prepare to resume my role, it would be a good idea if I can take time to learn the following;

* Java
* NodeJS
* ReactJS
* JavaScript
* ExpressJS
* HappyJS
* Linux
* Gitlab
* SVN
* Spark

So I have decided to start my learning with the following resources, the first is the EDX course on Java Programming.

I decided to take the course taught by Tim Bucksha on Udemy, to understand and learn Java, so in the month of March, I would solely concentrate on getting a mastery of Java programming language and nodeJS apart from my preparation for the conferences I have.

I need to be very disciplined in March to make tremendous progress.
