    "For now, let's implement a class called `Rational` for working with fractional numbers (e.g. 5/15). The first thing we'll need `Rational` to do is to be able to create a `Rational` object. We define how this should work with a special (hidden) method called `__init__`. We'll also define another special method called `__repr__` that tells Python how to print out the object."
