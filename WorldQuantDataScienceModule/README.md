This is a compilation of the code I wrote for the data science module of the World Quant University Data Science module. The course duration is 8 weeks and it comprises of  different lessons on Python programming and Data Science.

The courses explains:
* Object-oriented programming
* Pythonic programming
* Intro to Statistics
* Intro to numpy, Pandas and MatplotLib

I would try to finish this course this weekend hopefully because this is the second time I am doing this course and the first time I was unable to finish it because I was busy with my internship. Since I have spring break next week, I believe I can give undivided attention to this course and finish it.
