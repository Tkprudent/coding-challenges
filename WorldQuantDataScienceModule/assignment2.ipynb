By deepening our understanding of Python objects, we will be better prepared to work with complex data structures and machine learning models. We will develop a `Point` class capable of handling some simple linear algebra operations in 2D."

Our `Point` class should accept two arguments, `x` and `y`, and be represented by a string `'Point(x, y)'` with appropriate values for `x` and `y`.\n",
