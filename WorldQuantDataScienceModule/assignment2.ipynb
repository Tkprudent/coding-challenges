    "The objective of these exercises is to develop your familiarity with Python's `class` syntax and object-oriented programming. By deepening our understanding of Python objects, we will be better prepared to work with complex data structures and machine learning models. We will develop a `Point` class capable of handling some simple linear algebra operations in 2D."

    "The first step in defining most classes is to define their `__init__` and `__repr__` methods so that we can construct and represent distinct objects of that class. Our `Point` class should accept two arguments, `x` and `y`, and be represented by a string `'Point(x, y)'` with appropriate values for `x` and `y`.\n",

For two points $(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)$ and similarly for subtraction. Implement a method within `Point` that allows two `Point` objects to be added together using the `+` operator, and likewise for subtraction.
